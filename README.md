# console-kit

`console-kit` will be a tool that will help you logging information on the server and on the client,
with some very easy concepts like tags, levels, colors, and probably saving logs in a file.

We want the lightest library for client-side logging, so we may not use any library for this part, but for server-side we can, since nobody is downloading the library during runtime.
